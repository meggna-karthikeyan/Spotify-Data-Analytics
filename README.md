## üìù Overview  
This project focuses on **analyzing and optimizing a Spotify dataset** using **PostgreSQL**. It involves an **end-to-end process** of normalizing a **denormalized dataset**, writing **advanced SQL queries**, and applying **query performance optimization techniques**.  

Key objectives include:  
‚úÖ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using SQL queries  
‚úÖ **Aggregations, Joins, and Window Functions** for insights  
‚úÖ **Query Optimization** using Indexing and Execution Plans  
‚úÖ **Performance Improvement using EXPLAIN ANALYZE**

## üõ† SQL Schema & Table Creation  
The dataset is stored in a **PostgreSQL database** with the following schema:  

```sql
drop table if exists spotify;
create table spotify (
    artist VARCHAR(255),
    track VARCHAR(255),
    album VARCHAR(255),
    album_type VARCHAR(50),
    danceability FLOAT,
    energy FLOAT,
    loudness FLOAT,
    speechiness FLOAT,
    acousticness FLOAT,
    instrumentalness FLOAT,
    liveness FLOAT,
    valence FLOAT,
    tempo FLOAT,
    duration_min FLOAT,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    channel VARCHAR(255),
    views FLOAT,
    likes BIGINT,
    comments BIGINT,
    licensed BOOLEAN,
    official_video BOOLEAN,
    stream BIGINT,
    energy_liveness FLOAT,
    most_played_on VARCHAR(50)
);
```

## üîç SQL Queries & Data Analysis  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Basic SQL Queries (Easy Level)**  

#### **Retrieve the names of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams.**  
```sql
select * from spotify where stream > 1000000000;
```

#### **List all albums along with their respective artists.**  
```sql
select distinct album, artist from spotify;
```

#### **Get the total number of comments for tracks where licensed = TRUE.**  
```sql
select sum(comments) as total_comments from spotify where licensed = 'true';
```

#### **Find all tracks that belong to the album type single.**  
```sql
select * from spotify where album_type ilike 'single';
```

#### **Count the total number of tracks by each artist.**  
```sql
select artist, count(*) as total_number_of_tracks from spotify group by artist order by 2;
```

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Intermediate SQL Queries (Medium Level)**  

#### **Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album.**  
```sql
select album, avg(danceability) as avg_danceability from spotify group by album order by 2 desc;
```

#### **Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values.**  
```sql
select track, max(energy) as highest_energy from spotify group by 1 order by 2 desc limit 5;
```

#### **List all tracks along with their views and likes where official_video = TRUE.**  
```sql
select track, sum(views) as total_views, sum(likes) as total_likes from spotify where official_video = 'true'
group by 1 order by 2 desc;
```

#### **For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks.**  
```sql
select album, track, sum(views) as total_views from spotify group by 1,2 order by 3 desc;
```

#### **Retrieve the track names that have been streamed on Spotify more than YouTube.**  
```sql
select * from (select track,
	coalesce(sum(case when most_played_on = 'Spotify' then stream End),0) as streamed_on_spotify,
	coalesce(sum(case when most_played_on = 'Youtube' then stream End),0) as streamed_on_youtube
from spotify
group by 1) as most_streamed
where streamed_on_spotify > streamed_on_youtube and streamed_on_youtube <> 0;
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced SQL Queries (Hard Level)**  

#### **Find the top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist using window functions.**  
```sql
with ranking_artist as
	(select artist, track, sum(views) as total_views, dense_rank() over (partition by artist order by sum(views) desc) as rank 
	from spotify group by 1,2 order by 1,3 desc)
select * from ranking_artist where rank <=3;
```

#### **Find tracks where the liveness score is above the average.**  
```sql
select artist, track, liveness from spotify where liveness > (select avg(liveness) from spotify) order by 1,3 desc;
```

#### **Calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album.**  
```sql
with diff as (select album, max(energy) as highest_energy, min(energy) as lowest_energy from spotify group by 1)
select album, highest_energy - lowest_energy as energy_difference from diff order by 2 desc;
```

#### **Find tracks where the energy-to-liveness ratio is greater than 1.2.**  
```sql
select track, energy, liveness, (energy / nullif(liveness, 0)) as energy_liveness_ratio from spotify
where (energy / nullif(liveness, 0)) > 1.2 order by 4 desc;
```

#### **Calculate the cumulative sum of likes for tracks ordered by views.**  
```sql
select track, views, likes, sum(likes) over (order by views desc) as cumulative_likes from spotify;
```

## üöÄ SQL Query Optimization  

### **Performance Before Indexing (Slow Execution)**  
Before indexing, filtering queries required a **sequential scan**, leading to high execution time.

### **Indexing Optimization**  
To improve performance, we created an **index on the `artist` column** to speed up retrieval.  

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_artist ON spotify (artist);
```

### **Performance After Indexing (Optimized Execution)**  
After indexing, PostgreSQL switched to a **Bitmap Index Scan**, reducing execution time by **97%**.

## üîç SQL Queries & Data Analysis  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Basic SQL Queries (Easy Level)**  

#### **Retrieve the names of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams.**  
```sql
select * from spotify where stream > 1000000000;
```

#### **List all albums along with their respective artists.**  
```sql
select distinct album, artist from spotify;
```

#### **Get the total number of comments for tracks where licensed = TRUE.**  
```sql
select sum(comments) as total_comments from spotify where licensed = 'true';
```

#### **Find all tracks that belong to the album type single.**  
```sql
select * from spotify where album_type ilike 'single';
```

#### **Count the total number of tracks by each artist.**  
```sql
select artist, count(*) as total_number_of_tracks from spotify group by artist order by 2;
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Intermediate SQL Queries (Medium Level)**  

#### **Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album.**  
```sql
select album, avg(danceability) as avg_danceability from spotify group by album order by 2 desc;
```

#### **Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values.**  
```sql
select track, max(energy) as highest_energy from spotify group by 1 order by 2 desc limit 5;
```

#### **List all tracks along with their views and likes where official_video = TRUE.**  
```sql
select track, sum(views) as total_views, sum(likes) as total_likes
from spotify where official_video = 'true'
group by 1 order by 2 desc;
```

#### **For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks.**  
```sql
select album, track, sum(views) as total_views from spotify group by 1,2 order by 3 desc;
```

#### **Retrieve the track names that have been streamed on Spotify more than YouTube.**  
```sql
select * from (select track,
   coalesce(sum(case when most_played_on = 'Spotify' then stream End),0) as streamed_on_spotify,
   coalesce(sum(case when most_played_on = 'Youtube' then stream End),0) as streamed_on_youtube
from spotify
group by 1) as most_streamed
where streamed_on_spotify > streamed_on_youtube and streamed_on_youtube <> 0;
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced SQL Queries (Hard Level)**  

#### **Find the top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist using window functions.**  
```sql
with ranking_artist as
	(select artist, track, sum(views) as total_views,
	dense_rank() over (partition by artist order by sum(views) desc) as rank 
	from spotify group by 1,2 order by 1,3 desc)
select * from ranking_artist where rank <=3;
```

#### **Find tracks where the liveness score is above the average.**  
```sql
select artist, track, liveness from spotify
where liveness > (select avg(liveness) from spotify) order by 1,3 desc;
```

#### **Calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album.**  
```sql
with diff as (select album, max(energy) as highest_energy, min(energy) as lowest_energy
from spotify group by 1)
select album, highest_energy - lowest_energy as energy_difference from diff order by 2 desc;
```

#### **Find tracks where the energy-to-liveness ratio is greater than 1.2.**  
```sql
select track, energy, liveness, (energy / nullif(liveness, 0)) as energy_liveness_ratio from spotify
where (energy / nullif(liveness, 0)) > 1.2 order by 4 desc;
```

#### **Calculate the cumulative sum of likes for tracks ordered by views.**  
```sql
select track, views, likes, sum(likes) over (order by views desc) as cumulative_likes from spotify;
```

## üöÄ SQL Query Optimization  

### **Performance Before Indexing (Slow Execution)**  
Before indexing, filtering queries required a **sequential scan**, leading to high execution time.

**Execution Time (Before Indexing):**  
‚è≥ **5.593 ms**  

üö´ **Query Execution Plan (Before Indexing)**

### **Indexing Optimization**  
To improve performance, we created an **index on the `artist` column** to speed up retrieval.  

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_artist ON spotify (artist);
```

### **Performance After Indexing (Optimized Execution)**  
After indexing, PostgreSQL switched to a **Bitmap Index Scan**, reducing execution time by **97%**.

## üéØ Business Implications & Optimization Strategies  

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Identifying High-Performing Tracks & Artists:** By analyzing tracks with over **1 billion streams**, we can identify **top-performing songs**. This insight helps in prioritizing **marketing efforts, playlist placements, and collaborations** to boost engagement further.  

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Optimizing Single vs. Album Releases:**  The analysis of album types shows a **high number of single releases**. Artists and record labels can strategically release **singles before albums** to **build anticipation and maximize engagement** across streaming platforms.  

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Leveraging Platform-Specific Performance:**  Some tracks **perform better on Spotify than YouTube** and vice versa. This insight enables **targeted promotion strategies** where **Spotify-dominant tracks get playlist placements**, and **YouTube-dominant tracks receive music video promotions**.  

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Boosting Official Videos for Increased Visibility:**  Tracks with **official music videos** gain significantly **higher views and likes**. Encouraging artists to **release official videos** can help improve track visibility, fan engagement, and revenue generation. 

**5Ô∏è‚É£ Danceability & Energy-Based Recommendation Systems:**  Tracks with **high danceability and energy** are **more likely to go viral**. This data can be used to **enhance recommendation algorithms**, suggesting the right tracks for **workout, party, and relaxation playlists** to improve user retention.
